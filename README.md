# Marketing-Mixed-Modeling
My first attempt at an MMM in Python

I have not attached the actual data because it is way too large, but I have attached the Python notebook and R markdown files that enable you to follow along. In the Python notebook, we explore and clean the data for future modeling. Using the output from that notebook, in R we build the MMM models to assess the effect of the different marketing vehicles on grocery store sales.
